# Update the per-deployment branding env vars in the FIREBASE_ENV Secret Manager
# secret. Idempotent — safe to re-run; existing NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_* lines are
# replaced atomically with the new set, all other secret keys are preserved.
#
# v6.4.0 ONE-DEMO M1: per-deployment branding via build-time env vars
# (see docs/design/v6.4.0/multi-tenant-demo-readiness.md).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/update-deployment-branding.sh                # interactive, env=dev
#   scripts/update-deployment-branding.sh dev            # explicit
#   scripts/update-deployment-branding.sh dev --yes      # skip confirmation
#
# Safety:
#   - Refuses to write a secret that lacks NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
#     (proof we read a real Firebase env, not an empty/broken version)
#   - Shows before/after counts and a diff of just BRAND keys before pushing
#   - Disables broken intermediate versions on request
#
# Prereq: gcloud auth (mark@aitanalabs.com) with secretmanager.versions.access
#   gcloud config set account mark@aitanalabs.com
#
