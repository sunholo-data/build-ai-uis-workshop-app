/**
 * useBackendReady — polls `/api/proxy/health` until it returns 200, then
 * resolves. The signal indicates that the FastAPI sidecar behind the
 * Next.js proxy is reachable (it isn't always — Cloud Run cold starts
 * for `aitana-v6-backend` can take 5-30s on the first hit after scale-
 * to-zero, during which `/api/proxy/...` requests time out or 502).
 *
 * Strategy: probe immediately; on miss/error, retry with a short
 * backoff (1s → 1.5s → 2s …) until 200 or maxAttempts. Resolves true
 * on success; resolves false only if the hook unmounts or the deadline
 * passes (callers can re-mount to retry).
 *
 * Why /api/proxy/health and not /health directly: same-origin so the
 * call lives inside the Next.js dev / production server's auth
 * boundaries. Bypasses GFE-level auth gating.
 *
 * Returns `{ ready, attempts }`. `ready` is the boolean callers use to
 * gate UI; `attempts` is exposed for diagnostics / debug overlays.
